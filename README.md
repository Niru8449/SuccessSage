# Student Performance Prediction Model

## Project Overview
This repository contains an end-to-end project focused on developing a predictive model to estimate student performance. The project includes comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and the application of several machine learning techniques.

## Key Achievements

- **Predictive Modeling**: Developed a model to predict student performance, demonstrating a robust understanding of predictive modeling techniques.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Performed extensive EDA using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to uncover key insights that informed the development of the predictive models.
- **Machine Learning Implementation**: Applied multiple machine learning techniques and achieved the highest RÂ² score of 0.88 using Ridge Regression.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Libraries**: 
  - **Data Analysis & Visualization**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
  - **Machine Learning**: `scikit-learn`
